# Welcome to My Blog

I'm excited to launch this blog as a space to document my journey in software development, share technical insights, and explore the evolving landscape of web technologies.

## What to Expect

This blog will cover a range of topics, including:

- **Web Development**: Deep dives into React, Vite, and modern JavaScript frameworks
- **Software Engineering**: Best practices, design patterns, and architectural decisions
- **Project Updates**: Behind-the-scenes looks at building this site and other projects
- **Learning Notes**: Thoughts and discoveries from exploring new technologies

## Why I'm Blogging

Writing helps me:

1. **Clarify my thinking** — Explaining concepts forces deeper understanding
2. **Document solutions** — Future me will thank present me for the notes
3. **Share knowledge** — If it helps one person, it's worth it
4. **Build in public** — Transparency in the learning process

## The Technical Stack

This blog is built with:

- **React** for the UI components
- **Vite** for blazing-fast builds and development
- **Markdown** for content authoring (simple, version-controlled, no CMS complexity)
- **Custom Vite plugins** for build-time markdown processing

I'm a big believer in *keeping things simple*. No over-engineered solutions, no unnecessary dependencies. Just clean, maintainable code that solves real problems.

## Code Example

Here's a quick taste of what you'll see in future posts:

```javascript
// Simple reading time calculator
function calculateReadingTime(content, wordsPerMinute = 200) {
  const wordCount = content.trim().split(/\s+/).length;
  return Math.ceil(wordCount / wordsPerMinute);
}
```

Clean, focused, and practical.

## What's Next

I'm working on several posts exploring:

- How I built this site's routing system with smooth transitions
- Creating a custom Vite plugin for markdown processing
- Optimizing web font loading for performance

Stay tuned, and thanks for reading!
